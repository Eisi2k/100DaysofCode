# Day 7: Hangman Project

## Topics Covered:

### Project Overview:
- We begin working on a classic game project, Hangman, which consolidates various programming concepts learned so far.
- The project involves creating a word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses.

### Building the Hangman Logic:
- We discuss the basic structure and rules of the Hangman game.
- Implementing the game logic, including selecting a random word, tracking guessed letters, and updating the display.

### Lists and Loops:
- Utilizing lists to store and manage the letters in the secret word and the player's guesses.
- Using loops to iterate over the list of letters, checking guesses, and updating the game state.

### Conditional Statements:
- Applying conditional statements to check the player's input and determine the game's progress (e.g., correct guess, incorrect guess, win, or loss).

### User Interaction:
- Handling user input and providing appropriate feedback.
- Ensuring the game is interactive and user-friendly, with clear instructions and responses to player actions.

## Projects/Exercises:

### Hangman Game Implementation:
- The main exercise for the day is to implement the Hangman game in Python.
- The project challenges us to integrate our knowledge of variables, loops, lists, conditional statements, and functions into a cohesive program.
- Additional features, such as ASCII art for the hangman and input validation, are encouraged to enhance the game's visual and functional aspects.

## Key Learning Points:
- Reinforce understanding of fundamental programming concepts through a comprehensive project.
- Practice building a complete program from scratch, focusing on structure, logic, and user experience.
- Develop problem-solving skills by tackling the challenges of game development, such as handling edge cases and ensuring smooth gameplay.
- Gain confidence in using Python to create interactive applications.

Day 7 was a significant milestone, as it allowed me to apply everything I've learned so far in a single, cohesive project. The Hangman game provided a perfect challenge to practice working with lists, loops, and conditionals, all while developing a fun and interactive application. Angela's guidance helped me navigate the complexities of the project, and completing the game felt like a real achievement. It was rewarding to see how much I could accomplish with just a week's worth of Python knowledge, and I'm excited to continue building on these skills.
