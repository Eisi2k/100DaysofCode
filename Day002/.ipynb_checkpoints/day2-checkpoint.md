# Day 2: Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

## Topics Covered:

### Python Data Types:
- We delve into the different data types in Python, such as strings, integers, and floats.
- Understanding data types is crucial as it affects how we manipulate and interact with data.

### Type Checking and Conversion:
- We learn how to check the type of a variable using the `type()` function.
- Type conversion is introduced, where we convert data from one type to another (e.g., from string to integer using `int()`).

### String Manipulation and Formatting:
- More advanced string manipulation techniques are covered.
- We explore string indexing and slicing to access specific parts of a string.
- String formatting methods like f-strings (`f"{variable}"`) are introduced to create more readable and dynamic text outputs.

### Arithmetic Operations:
- Basic arithmetic operations in Python are explained, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- We also touch on more complex operations like exponentiation and floor division.

## Projects/Exercises:

### Tip Calculator:
- A practical project where we build a tip calculator.
- The project involves taking user inputs for the total bill, tip percentage, and number of people to split the bill.
- We then calculate the amount each person should pay, practicing our new skills in arithmetic operations and type conversion.

## Key Learning Points:
- Gain a deeper understanding of different data types in Python and how to work with them.
- Learn to check and convert data types, which is essential for data manipulation.
- Master string indexing, slicing, and formatting to handle text data efficiently.
- Practice arithmetic operations, a fundamental aspect of many programming tasks.
- Implement a real-world project, reinforcing the concepts learned and building confidence in your coding abilities.

On Day 2, I found myself getting more comfortable with Python. The concept of data types and how they impact our code became clearer. Angela's teaching style made even complex topics seem approachable. The Tip Calculator project was a fantastic way to apply what I had learned, making the learning experience both practical and rewarding. Each new concept added another piece to the puzzle, making me more excited about the days ahead and the coding challenges to come.
